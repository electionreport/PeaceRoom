# About [electionreport.org](http://electionreport.org)
This is an open source tool/service for reporters to use to track, display and of course, report on elections.

Elections can be for anything:
* Clubs
* Charities
* NGOs
* Local councils
* and of course regular elections

There are two parts to the system:

1. The reporting portion which is a responsive, mobile friendly mini-survey
2. The WarRoom where the results are displayed

# Reporter Mobile App
The mobile app is a hybrid app that will be available on the Android and iPhone platforms only.

Data gathered:

* Exit Polls
* Sentimnent Survey
* Voter Intentions (for no polling day events- e.g. campaign events) to capture data for accurate simulations
* Rally / Event Sentiments
* Campaign Promises
* Policy Sentiment
* Hot Topic Sentiment

# WarRoom Visualistion Dashboard
The visualations dashboard is where thee data is presnted with the usual graphs, charts, trend lines etc.

## Features:
* Candidate Tracking
* Candidate Profiles (results tracking based on exit polls, sentinment analysis and social media tracking)
* Heatmaps
* District Trend Analysis (if historical data present)
* Social Media Tracking (based on hastags only and name mentions)
* Fitering by candidate, trends (current and historical if available), district, state, specific social media
* Analysis of aal the data collected by the *reporter app*.

# RoadMap
The current version supppots the main warroom and the reporter modules. In the future we plan to have a heirarchy structure, so for something like a national election, local distrct vote, then state/county level, then national level.

# Community
We hope this project will attract academics, reporters, the gnereal public and others who will contribute in these and other areas:

* Translations
* Data Analysis
* Inputting historical data for trend analysis
* Capturing Data during elections
* Contributing to the technical side of the project
* Social media mentions and more!

# Goals for the Project

The intent is only to use modern technology to capture data that reporters are already doing by other means.

# Politically Agnostic

This project is not funded, owned or in anyway associated with any politicial party in any country.
